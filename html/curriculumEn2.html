					<li>
						<p class="g-desc"><strong>EPS TOPIK</strong></p>
						<ul class="info-list decimal">
							<li>

							</li>
							<li>

							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="g-desc">Target: Foreign workers who will work in specific industries such as manufacturing and construction.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="g-desc">Scoring Requirements: It varies by industry, but usually requires meeting acceptance criteria to obtain work permits in Korea. This ensures minimal language proficiency, and contributes to maintaining a safe and efficient work environment.</p>

						<p class="g-desc"><strong>TOPIK (General TOPIK)</strong></p>
						<ul class="info-list decimal">
							<li>
								<p class="g-desc">Purpose: General TOPIK is mainly used to measure Korean proficiency, aiming at studying abroad, studying, and working life in Korea. As a formal way to prove a Korean learner's language ability, the Korean language ability is evaluated through a multi-step test.</p>
							</li>
							<li>

							<li>
								<p class="g-desc">Targets: International students, applicants to enter Korean universities, foreigners who want a job in Korea, etc.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="g-desc">Scoring Requirements: TOPIK II often requires Level 3 or higher, depending on college admission, scholarships, and some jobs. A department or occupation that requires advanced proficiency may require Level 5 or higher.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="g-desc">
					Since the two tests have a clear objective and objective, those preparing for the test should choose one that suits their goals and needs. EPS TOPIK is mainly for those who want to enter the labor market, and ordinary TOPIK is for those who have academic or professional goals.
				</p>
				<p class="g-desc">
					Universities in Korea are demanding language proficiency requirements differently depending on their level of evaluation, including 1) outstanding universities, 2) certified universities, 3) general universities, 4) consulting universities, and 5) visa-restricted universities. Therefore, this classification can affect TOPIK score requirements that potential foreign students need.
				</p>
				<ol class="info-list num fsn">
					<li>
						<p class="g-desc"><strong>Superior Universities : </strong> These are typically top-level universities, which can require a higher TOPIK level so that students can effectively carry out academic instructions and activities conducted in the Korean language. They can usually require TOPIK level 4 or higher.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="g-desc"><strong>Certified Colleges : </strong> These universities are certified in quality but may not be as strict as outstanding universities. Typical TOPIK requirements may be level 3 or higher.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="g-desc"><strong>General universities : </strong> In these universities, the requirements may be more flexible, accepting TOPIK levels 2 to 3, which demonstrate the ability to conduct daily conversations and some academic discussions.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="g-desc"><strong>Consulting Universities : </strong> These universities may provide additional support or require other criteria for international students or students with poor Korean proficiency. TOPIK requirements may vary greatly for individual programs.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="g-desc"><strong>Visa-Restricted University : </strong> These institutions may be subject to stricter regulations due to several administrative or governmental constraints.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="g-desc">
					TOPIK preparation includes approaches that cover reading, writing, and listening skills, and each section is evaluated by reflecting levels ranging from 1st (lowest) to 6th (highest proficiency) in the total possible score.<br>
					TOPIK requirements are often linked to immigration and visa policies, and they must demonstrate sufficient Korean proficiency.
